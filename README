SETTING UP A TEST SERVER
========================

1. Download & install VirtualBox: https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.22/VirtualBox-5.2.22-126460-Win.exe

2. Download CentOS7:  http://mirrors.tummy.com/mirrors/CentOS/7.5.1804/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1804.torrent

3. If you're on windows you might need something like PowerISO to mount the .iso file as a drive

4. Run the CentOS installer
    a. Be sure the CentOS iso is mounted as a drive
    b. Open VirtualBox and choose New-Virtual Machine.  Give it a name and set the resources you want
    c. Change the VM settings to boot from DVD first
    d. Start the Virtual Machine and follow the prompts to install CentOS

5. Have your favorite database tool handy (I'm currently trying out HeidiSQL but really any good sql client works)

6. Have your favorite SSH client(s) handy too (I like WinSCP and Putty)

7. Have your favorite Python IDE handy (I'm using PyCharm)

8. Give yourself a non-root user if you haven't already:
    > adduser USERNAME
    > passwd USERNAME
    > usermod -aG wheel USERNAME

9. From this repo, use SCP to copy the script install/install.sh to the test server, change permissions, and run it!
    > chmod +x install.sh
    > sudo ./install.sh
